# Snake Game Variation
I added background music, sound effects, new feeds, levels, and score recording functions in the existing snake game.
# Game rule
- Press arrow keys to move snake.
- If the snake's head touches its own body or the edge of the window, the game is over.
- When snake eats a feed, snake's length and speed increase.(This effect is the same for any kind of feed)

- Additional effects
 
  \- Orange feed: none
 
  \- Red feed: speed up 
 
  \- Green feed: speed down
- You can monitor the extra speed (due to red and green feed) from the top of the window.
